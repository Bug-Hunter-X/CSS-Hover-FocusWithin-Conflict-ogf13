# CSS Bug: :hover and :focus-within Conflict

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug involving unexpected behavior when using both the `:hover` and `:focus-within` pseudo-classes on nested elements in CSS.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when trying to style a nested element based on both the hover state of its parent and the focus state of any descendant element within the parent. The hover effect is unexpectedly overridden or interfered with by the focus-within state.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Inspect the `bug.css` file for the CSS code causing the problem. 
2.  Open the HTML file (not provided here, but would contain elements matching the selectors in `bug.css`).
3.  Hover over the outer element. The nested element will change color (yellow). 
4.  Click inside the inner element to set focus. The expected behavior is that the inner element should stay yellow (from the hover). However, it changes to orange because of the `:focus-within` state which interferes with the `:hover`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to this issue, ensuring both `:hover` and `:focus-within` work as expected without overriding each other.
